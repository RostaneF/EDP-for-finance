# European Options Pricing in Finance

## Introduction
This project develops robust methods for pricing European options using advanced numerical techniques, focusing on finite difference methods pivotal in quantitative finance for modeling and pricing derivative products.

## Features
- **Numerical Schemes**: Implementation of Euler Explicit, Euler Implicit, and Crank-Nicolson schemes.
- **Schema Class**: Designed for problem-solving in financial mathematics.
- **Convergence & Stability Analysis**: Detailed examination of numerical stability and convergence across various schemes.

## Installation
To clone the repository:
```
git clone [repository URL]
```

## Usage
Example of initializing and utilizing the `Schema` class:
```python
from schema import Schema
schema = Schema(parameters...)
schema.compute()
```

## Highlights
- **Performance Analysis**: Evaluates different numerical schemes' efficiency and applicability.
- **Visualizations**: Comparative plots illustrating accuracy and efficiency against analytical solutions.
